# ProjectS (2009-2010):
This is the last iteration of the engine. It was produced just before the FuetAthlon 2010 (See FuetEngine project)

## Engine features at this point.
Huge refactoring started during this stage of the project but it was left halfdone after the FuetAthlon event.
The main aim of the refactor was trying to unify the classes naming of the systems and trying to adapt a strong nomenclature, while adding comments to methods. 
While implementing the refactor many things left not compiling. Now, in 2025, I finally made the projects build properly again.
